# WP RESULTS WordPress plugin

The mission of this project is to enable creating web applications by only few clicks. 
"Wp Results" consists of two main modules:

1. Form to input and process data. 
2. Composer to display stored data.  

Ultimately, I would like to publish kits based on "Wp Results" which enable building almost any app and portal. I am going to show it on examples like: work portals, photostocks, event portals, complex ecommerce apps and web solutions. In order to present possibilities of "Wp Results" each portal will have its own, dedicated CRM module.

At first I'll try show how to create [work portal](https://github.com/dadmor/Results/wiki/WorkPortal-Example).

PS. Project are still in progress and waiting to contributors ;)
